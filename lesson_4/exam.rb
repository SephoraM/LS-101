 # exam mistakes and the lesson

 # Question 8: This one is frustrating because I thought that I hadn't
 #             selected A. I knew that select did not return nil but
 #             instead returned an empty collection so.... grrrrr.

 # Question 10: I believe that this is transformation based on selection
 #              so perhaps this could be a little clearer.

 # Question 17: I did wonder whether or not I was doing the right thing by
 #              including C because I knew the original object would not be
 #              returned, but all the same elements would exist within a new
 #              array. Rereading the question, it seems pretty clear what was
 #              called for.

 # Question 18: Didn't catch that D put them in the wrong order.
